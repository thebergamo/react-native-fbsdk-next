# PRs Welcome


Nothing much to add to that ;-), but this is an open source module. We always need contributors. We welcome PRs. We can merge and release them very quickly. Please help us keep the module working by digging in and helping fix problems instead of just logging them, thank you!

# Development Guide

The best way to develop the module is to fork/clone the repo, then develop against the example app.

Here is a procedure that works:

1. Fork the repo on github
1. `git clone git@github.com:<your github username>/react-native-fbsdk.next.git`
1. `cd react-native-fbsdk-next`
1. `yarn`
1. Follow the instructions in [RNFBSDKExample/README.md](the example README) related to using the example to test changes to the core module
